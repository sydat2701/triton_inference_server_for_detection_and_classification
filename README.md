This repo is an example of using Triton Inference Server for a deep learning pipeline (detect objects using faster_rnn, then use resnet for classification). You can download Resnet and Faster_rnn weights from this link: \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O2We2mLgJMrzzdGj6V7Cz6LEfO89ILmi?usp=sharing}. Then rename them to "model.onnx" and place in corresponding "1" folder in "docs/examples/model_repository" for some experiences.
